        "For this you will be using Python to create and merge two subsets of average temperture changes in differernt season in differernt states using date provided by the Washington Post\n",
        ">For this dataset we will look at Alabama and Maine for the average temperture change\n",

        "## Purpose\n",
        "Climate Change is one of the most important issues the world is currently facing. Data has been an important piece in seeing the affects of climate change. In analyzing data of temperture changes over an extented period of time in different regions, we are able to understand the changes happening there.\n",

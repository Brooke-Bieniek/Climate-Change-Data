# Climate-Change-Data
This repository was created in April of 2024 for Professer Gotzler's Engligh 105 class at the Univeristy of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

1. The raw data in this repository was altered using Pandas with google colab
2. In the repository you will find the raw data, the created subset,  Data visulization, and a guide to recreate the subset!

---------

### Purpose of this Repository
Climate Change is one of the most important issues the world is currently facing. Data has been an important piece in seeing the affects of climate change. In analyzing data of temperture changes over an extented period of time in different regions, we are able to understand the changes happening there. 

----------

### Where was the Data gethered from? 
The Data came from the Washington Post that used and analylized data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Divisional Database and Gridded 5km GHCN Daily temperture and precipitation Dataset

----------
### Potential uses?
1. This data can be used to compare and contrast the affects of climate change betweeen differernt states or regions in the united states
2. The general public can uses this data to recreate a subset that analyzes average temperture changes in each season in their state
3. This data set can be used as a graphic to show the affects of climate change to policy makers 

-----------
### Data Visualization
>The visualization was created using Data Wrapper

>The Visualization below shows the two data points we are analyzing (Maine and Alabama).
